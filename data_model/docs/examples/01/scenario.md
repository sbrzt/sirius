# Example 01: Dissociation risk in a digital collection

Dissociation is a natural process in ordered systems leading to the disgregation of objects or object-related data over time.
It can manifest in various ways, such as events resulting in extensive loss of data, objects, or object values, and primarily affects the legal, intellectual, and cultural aspects of objects, distinguishing it from other types of hazard that mainly impact physical state. 
Actions contributing to dissociation include misplacing objects, removing identifying labels, and mishandling culturally sensitive items. 
Failures to act, like neglecting collection maintenance or not migrating electronic data, also increase dissociation risks. 
Its effects range from compromising object identification to complete loss of collections and documentation. 
Preventive measures involve documentation, clear ownership transfer, proper data managing procedures, and maintaining updated records.

In conducting a risk assessment to evaluate risks associated with resources in a library, the process begins with describing the contexts surrounding the library (e.g. its economic, social and cultural context). 
Then, potential hazards are identified. For a library, these include, for example, the continuous mismanagement of electronic records, which in turn contributes to dissociation. 
Next, the identified risks are identified and their occurrence likelihood is calculated in terms of frequency (how often the event is expected to occur), the size of the expected loss of value, and the amount of value affected. 
Then, the impact of the analyzed risks is estimated and, based on that, a priority order is established. 
Subsequently, according to the priority of assigned to each risk, a series of treatment strategies are developed to eliminate, weaken or somehow limit the factors leading to such risks, such as implementing comprehensive data management policies and ensuring regular backups against dissociation-related risks.
