It was developed by using a slightly modified version of the [Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development (SAMOD)](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3189769). \n\nBoth HeRO and its [documentation](https://w3id.org/sirius/ontology/hero) are living artefacts that have been and still are being drafted in the context of the [Project CHANGES](https://sites.google.com/uniroma1.it/changes/) (\"Cultural Heritage Active Innovation For Next-Gen Sustainable Society\"), an EU-funded project that aims at increasing, in the Italian context, the curation, and management of cultural heritage artefacts in all forms, expanding the involvement of the general public, making the exhibition potential more sustainable, and including crucial social functions (accessibility, inclusiveness, critical thinking, participation, enjoyment, sustainability) into the cultural heritage environment.\n\nCurrently, HeRO is able to describe the following entities:\n* Assessment activities and their provenance information (who carried out or participated in an activity, when, where, what was done, and how);\n* Linguistic objects (scientific observations, statements, assertions, speculations, etc.), assigned to objects being examined during assessment activites;\n* Information objects (concepts, classifications, categories, etc.), referred to by the linguistic objects and representing the aspects and attributes related in some way to the objects being examined during assessment activities.\n\nThe current version of HeRO reuses a series of Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) by defining its own set of classes and properties and conceptualizing them as subclasses and subproperties of the reused ODPs' entities. More specifically, HeRO reuses the following models:\n\n* [Basic Plan Execution ODP](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/basicplanexecution.owl#)\n* [Componency ODP](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/componency.owl#)\n* [Friend Of A Friend](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/)\n* [Intension Extension ODP](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/intensionextension.owl#)\n* [Object Role ODP](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/objectrole.owl#)\n* [Participation ODP](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/participation.owl#)\n* [Place ODP](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/place.owl#)\n* [Provenance Ontology](http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#)\n* [Sequence ODP](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/sequence.owl#)\n* [Situation ODP](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/situation.owl#)\n* [Dublin Core Terms](http://purl.org/dc/terms/)\n* [Time Indexed Situation ODP](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/timeindexedsituation.owl#)\n* [Time Interval ODP](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/timeinterval.owl#)\n\nA full version of HeRO is available at [https://w3id.org/sirius/ontology/hero](https://w3id.org/sirius/ontology/hero).\n\nThe next subsections provide a quick overview of all the entities defined, some exemple of usage, and some of the queries that HeRO can answer.\n\n### Assessment activities\nIn HeRO, the concept of assessment activity represents the core abstraction around which the rest of the ontology is built. As shown in the following diagram, an assessment activity is a first-class object related to a series of other entities that populate and signify its context. \n\n![A diagram of an assessment activity, the core entity of HeRO.](diagrams/assessment-activity.png)\n\nAs previously mentioned, HeRO draws constructs from ODPs and uses them as super classes and super properties of its own entities to accurately represent the processes outlined by a risk assessment endeavor, as well as the concepts and relations implicitly expressed in such processes. In particular, an assessment activity (`hero:Activity`) is a situated action that involves gaining and producing scientific knowledge about some entity being observed by assigning to that entity a series of assertions referring to concepts used to make the assessment. As a result, it has been modelled as a subclass of `tisit:TimeIndexedSituation` and `planex:Action` that assigns to a object (`owl:Thing`) a series of \"linguistic objects\" (`hero:LinguisticObject`) representing scientific observations, statements or assertions related to that object. Multiple activities can be sequentialized one after the other with `hero:precedes`. In addition, an assessment activity is enriched with a packet of additional information covering its type (`hero:Type`), its temporal horizon (`ti:TimeInterval`), its geographic context (`place:Place`), the agents involved in its realization (`foaf:Agent`), the material documenting how the activity was carried out and based on what sources (`foaf:Document`), and its textual description (`hero:hasNote`).\n\n### Scientific assertions and concepts\nAs illustrated in the previous section, an assessment activity assigns a series of assertions to the objects being examined. As shown in the following diagram, an assertion (`hero:LinguisticObject`) is modelled as a subclass of `hero:InformationObject`, thus incorporating the idea of an assertion as a piece of information, independently from how it is concretely realized. In turn, an assertion refers to some qualitative, quantitative or interpretative conceptual object (`hero:InformationObject`), modelled as a subclass of `intensionextension:InformationObject`, that carries some information that is deemed relevant in the context of risk assessment.\n\n![A diagram of a linguistic object and an information object, the other core entities of HeRO.](diagrams/objects.png)\n\nIn addition to referring to some concept, an assertion can be classified according to external categorization schemes (`hero:Type`), can be documented by some document (`foaf:Document`), can be also motivated by other concepts referred to in other assertions, and expresses some kind of content or value (`hero:hasContent`). A concept, while also being characterized by a type (`hero:Type`) and a content (`hero:hasContent`), can be composed of other conceptual objects (`hero:hasComponent`).\n\n## Examples of use\nHeRO can be used for modelling scenarios related to heritage risk assessment. Note that, due to the wide scope of the classes and properties it uses, the way it has been modelled, and its dependency on external vocabularies for typification, HeRO can be used to model any situation involving assigning scientific assertions expressing some kind of conceptual content to an object in order to examine it. \n\nIn the following subsections we introduce some scenarios pertaining to the cultural heritage risk domain, and we accompany them with exemplar instantiations. \n\nThe prefixes that are used in all the examples provided below are defined as follows:\n\n    @prefix : <https://w3id.org/sirius/ontology/hero/data/example/> .\n    @prefix aat: <http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/> .\n    @prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .\n    @prefix freq: <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/frequency/> .\n    @prefix hero: <https://w3id.org/sirius/ontology/hero/> .\n    @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n    @prefix place: <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/place.owl#> .\n    @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n    @prefix ti: <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/timeinterval.owl#> .\n    @prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .\n\n### Scenario 1\nAn assessment activity `:assessment-activity-01` consisting in the context description of a CHO `:baptistery`, is taking place in Ravenna, is being carried out by the expert Sara Fiorentino (with the involvement of other stakeholders, such as Comune di Ravenna, Soprintendenza di Ravenna and Università di Bologna), in the time interval starting from 2024-02-01 to 2024-03-01, and is being annotated with the following text: \"Octagonal building with sloping roof, featuring four apsidioles corresponding to the cardinal points (partially buried).

a CHO `:baptistery`, is taking place in Ravenna and is being carried out by the expert Sara Fiorentino, in the time interval starting from 2024-05-01 to 2024-06-01, continuing `:assessment-activity-05`. It is annotated with the following text: \"The risk of flood (MR = 10.5) has a high priority. It is 100 times smaller than the fire risk. The uncertainty that has been measured amounts to a value equal to 2.5. A risk of this magnitude is equivalent to losing about 0.3% of the heritage asset value every 100 years (or 3% per millennium). The museum direction considers this level of risk as just beyond acceptable, since as a condition the value of MR is slightly higher than 10 and the value of uncertainty is higher than 2.\" It consists of one statement assigned to the CHO in question:\n1. `:observation-24`, which is a diagnosis motivated by `:parameter-19` and referring to a high level of priority(`:concept-24`).\n\nAnother assessment activity `:assessment-activity-08` consisting in the evaluation of risks related to the CHO `:baptistery` is taking place in Ravenna and is being carried out by the expert Sara Fiorentino, in the time interval starting from 2024-05-01 to 2024-06-01, following `:assessment-activity-06`.

If used in a transformation pattern for n-ary relations, the designer should take care of:\n- creating only one situation for each instance of an n-ary relation, otherwise the 'identification constraint' (Calvanese et al., IJCAI 2001) could be violated\n- adding an 'exact cardinality' restriction corresponding to the arity of the n-ary relation, otherwise the designer would actually represent a polymorphic relation."

      "undefined" : "The relation between an InformationObject and a 'meaning'.\nWhat is a meaning is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. For example, lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of term is a paraphrase (or 'gloss', or 'definition'). Another approach is provided by concept schemes like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a 'concept', possibly encoded as a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'. Still another approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. A radically different approach is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meaning of an information object is spread across the members of a community that use that object. The logical approach to meaning is completely different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an individual person called Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc. Finally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.\n\nThese different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized, and modelled withih DOLCE-Ultralite, as follows:\n(1) Intensional meaning\n\t- Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description\n\t- Conceptual meaning (as for psychological and 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Concept\n\t- Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject that act as 'paraphrases'\n\t- Cultural meaning (as for social science semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject\n\n(2) Extensional meaning (as for logic and formal semantics)\n\t- Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Collection\n\t- Modal formal meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Collections as located in another Collection that isFormallyRepresentedIn a PossibleWorld\n\nFor example:\n- the term Beehive expresses the Concept Beehive\n- the term Beehive expresses the Description BeingABeehive, a relation that defines concepts such as Bee, Honey, Habitation, etc.\n- the text of Italian Constitution expresses the 'content' of the Constitution\n- your email expresses an aggressive attitude"

      "undefined" : "The relation between an InformationObject and a 'meaning'.\nWhat is a meaning is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. For example, lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of term is a paraphrase (or 'gloss', or 'definition'). Another approach is provided by concept schemes like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a 'concept', possibly encoded as a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'. Still another approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. A radically different approach is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meaning of an information object is spread across the members of a community that use that object. The logical approach to meaning is completely different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an individual person called Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc. Finally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.\n\nThese different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized, and modelled withih DOLCE-Ultralite, as follows:\n(1) Intensional meaning\n\t- Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description\n\t- Conceptual meaning (as for psychological and 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Concept\n\t- Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject that act as 'paraphrases'\n\t- Cultural meaning (as for social science semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject\n\n(2) Extensional meaning (as for logic and formal semantics)\n\t- Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Collection\n\t- Modal formal meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Collections as located in another Collection that isFormallyRepresentedIn a PossibleWorld\n\nFor example:\n- the term Beehive expresses the Concept Beehive\n- the term Beehive expresses the Description BeingABeehive, a relation that defines concepts such as Bee, Honey, Habitation, etc.\n- the text of Italian Constitution expresses the 'content' of the Constitution\n- your email expresses an aggressive attitude"

      "undefined" : "The relation between an InformationObject and a 'meaning'.\nWhat is a meaning is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. For example, lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of term is a paraphrase (or 'gloss', or 'definition'). Another approach is provided by concept schemes like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a 'concept', possibly encoded as a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'. Still another approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. A radically different approach is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meaning of an information object is spread across the members of a community that use that object. The logical approach to meaning is completely different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an individual person called Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc. Finally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.\n\nThese different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized, and modelled withih DOLCE-Ultralite, as follows:\n(1) Intensional meaning\n\t- Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description\n\t- Conceptual meaning (as for psychological and 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Concept\n\t- Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject that act as 'paraphrases'\n\t- Cultural meaning (as for social science semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject\n\n(2) Extensional meaning (as for logic and formal semantics)\n\t- Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Collection\n\t- Modal formal meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Collections as located in another Collection that isFormallyRepresentedIn a PossibleWorld\n\nFor example:\n- the term Beehive expresses the Concept Beehive\n- the term Beehive expresses the Description BeingABeehive, a relation that defines concepts such as Bee, Honey, Habitation, etc.\n- the text of Italian Constitution expresses the 'content' of the Constitution\n- your email expresses an aggressive attitude"

      "undefined" : "The relation between an InformationObject and a 'meaning'.\nWhat is a meaning is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. For example, lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of term is a paraphrase (or 'gloss', or 'definition'). Another approach is provided by concept schemes like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a 'concept', possibly encoded as a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'. Still another approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. A radically different approach is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meaning of an information object is spread across the members of a community that use that object. The logical approach to meaning is completely different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an individual person called Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc. Finally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.\n\nThese different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized, and modelled withih DOLCE-Ultralite, as follows:\n(1) Intensional meaning\n\t- Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description\n\t- Conceptual meaning (as for psychological and 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Concept\n\t- Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject that act as 'paraphrases'\n\t- Cultural meaning (as for social science semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject\n\n(2) Extensional meaning (as for logic and formal semantics)\n\t- Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Collection\n\t- Modal formal meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Collections as located in another Collection that isFormallyRepresentedIn a PossibleWorld\n\nFor example:\n- the term Beehive expresses the Concept Beehive\n- the term Beehive expresses the Description BeingABeehive, a relation that defines concepts such as Bee, Honey, Habitation, etc.\n- the text of Italian Constitution expresses the 'content' of the Constitution\n- your email expresses an aggressive attitude"
