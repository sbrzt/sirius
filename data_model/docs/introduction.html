<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In recent decades, the role of cultural heritage in disaster management has been increasingly recognized as a fundamental facilitator for post-disaster recovery, development and resilience <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-57165-2_22">(Ravankhah et al. 2017)</a> as well as fostering a sense of community and identity <a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/DPM-08-2018-0285">(Minguez Garcia 2020)</a>.
However, it is challenging to put in place adequate risk management strategies against possible threats to heritage institutions and the artifacts they work to preserve, manage, and share with both academia and the general public. 
Obstacles within cultural heritage institutions like galleries, museums, libraries, and archives include methodological divergences between research communities <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/155019061200800405">(Bullock 2012)</a>, an inadequate knowledge of the assets and the inability to evaluate their worth from a non-market perspective <a href="https://www.eird.org/estrategias/pdf/eng/doc13119/doc13119-contenido.pdf">(Taboroff 2000)</a>, lack of knowledge sharing, the need for better communication between different disciplines involved in heritage risk assessment, and the need to engage more effectively with local stakeholders <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.103625">(Durrent 2023)</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cli2.45">(Adger et al. 2013)</a>. 
Furthermore, with the emergence of digital technologies and their increasing use in the cultural heritage sector, there are also growing concerns about the preservation, sustainability, accessibility and usability of digital materials over time <a href="https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/risk-management-foundations-for-digital-libraries-drambora-digita">(McHugh et al. 2007)</a> <a href="https://dlib.org/dlib/september12/vermaaten/09vermaaten.print.html">(Vermaaten et al. 2012)</a>.</p>
<p>Project CHANGES (Cultural Heritage Active Innovation For Next-Gen Sustainable Society), an EU-funded initiative that began in December 2022, serves as the operational framework for the research described in this document.
In addition to integrating important social functions such as accessibility, inclusivity, critical thinking, participation, enjoyment and sustainability into the field of cultural heritage, CHANGES aims to increase public engagement and promote sustainable cultural heritage curation and management practices in accordance with the European Cultural Heritage guidelines.
In particular, one of the research lines pursued within CHANGES is dedicated to develop and apply integrated methodologies, strategies and approaches to support the processes of historical understanding, conservation, restoration, monitoring, sustainable and participatory planning in multi-layered contexts of cultural heritage.
The present work falls into this specific area of investigation. Specifically, the SIRIUS project, initiated by the University of Bologna&#39;s Department of Cultural Heritage, aims to streamline the process of assessing heritage-related risks and effectively communicate this information to the general public by creating localized guidelines for disaster risk management in the context of cultural, environmental, and digital heritage. These localized versions are then projected into a higher level of abstraction, where they become general guidelines that revolve around prevalent terminologies and methodologies able to describe most objects, contexts and situations related to risk heritage management.</p>
<p>This, however, poses a number of challenges.
Indeed, risk assessment is a complex process that involves a number of different activities, ranging from examining the context surrounding the object being examined to identifying potential hazards threatening its integrity, to assessing their impact in terms of loss of value, developing treatment options, and so on. 
More generally, the concept of risk is inherently tethered with the notions of value, uncertainty, subjective interpretation and objective analysis <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-00847-5_11">(Sales et al. 2018)</a>, thus making its ontological status extremely difficult to deal with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2011.04.015">(Aven et al. 2011)</a>. 
In order to meet the requirements of the aforementioned projects, the formal representation ensure by the use of technologies such as ontologies <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0269888900007797">(Uschold and Gruninger 1996)</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-92673-3_0">(Guarino et al. 2009)</a> was deemed to be appropriate for describing the domain of heritage risk assessment in a way that facilitates the management, access, interoperability and reusability of data related to heritage risk to both the research community and the general public <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-37022-4\_4">(Ding et al. 2007)</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-88-470-1778-8_14">(Nota et al. 2010)</a>. </p>
<p>A previous paper <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3643/paper18.pdf">(Barzaghi 2023)</a> addressed how to formulate a machine-readable representation of the risk assessment process as specified in the ABC method <a href="https://books.google.pl/books?id=z8zDEAAAQBAJ">(Coelho et al. 2023)</a>, a risk assessment framework used to meet the scientific and communicative needs of SIRIUS. 
The result of this study was the first draft of the Heritage Risk Assessment Ontology (HeRO, <a href="https://w3id.org/sirius/ontology/hero/1.0.0/">https://w3id.org/sirius/ontology/hero/1.0.0/</a>), an OWL 2 DL ontology for reppresenting machine-readable heritage risk assessment procedures. 
The study examined the process by which HeRO has been designed and developed. 
Then, it introduced the model proper, and showcased its application through an exemplary use case. 
Finally, it concluded by illustrating a series of indications for possible ways to enhance the model in the future. 
These included the need to enhance the model&#39;s adaptability to different contexts (e.g. other forms of heritage, including digital cultural heritage) and different risk assessment methodologies. 
After all, the first version of HeRO was explicitly focused on the ABC method, which - while quite used - is not the most widespread risk assessment methodology. 
Thus, HeRO suffered from employing a series of classes and properties tailored too tight to a single methodology and the tangible type of cultural heritage. 
This greatly limited the model&#39;s FAIRness, especially in terms of its reusability and interoperability, and thus its possibility to formally describe the heritage risk management domain and somehow align such description with other existing and widespread models, such as the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model <a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/DagSemProc.04391.22">(Doerr 2005)</a> and Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-92673-3_10">(Gangemi and Presutti 2009)</a>.</p>
<p>This document presents the latest iteration of HeRO, which involves a significant overhaul of its original framework. Its objective remains to describe risk assessment procedures within the cultural heritage sector in a format that is machine-readable.
This updated version maintains a pattern-based approach, but now transforms the entire ontology into a generalized pattern for representing assessments as activities that attribute scientific assertions about conceptual categories to any type of examinable entity, whether physical or conceptual. Notably, this pattern aligns seamlessly with CIDOC CRM, the predominant ontology in the heritage domain, and is explicitly grounded in the FAIR principles, particularly those pertaining to interoperability and reusability.</p>
