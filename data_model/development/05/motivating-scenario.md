# Iteration 05

## Name
Evaluate step activity

## Description
This step consists in an evaluation of each specific risk relative to other risks or to some criteria. It involves comparing the risks with each other, evaluating their level of priority, and deciding within the institution which risks are acceptable and which ones are not and therefore must be ‘treated’.

The main criterion used to compare and evaluate risks is their magnitude (MR). Below is a scale of MR values classified according to their level of priority: 
* catastrophic: all or most of the heritage asset value is likely to be lost in a few years; 
* extreme: significant damage to all the heritage asset, or total loss of a significant fraction of the heritage asset, is possible in approximately one decade; 
* high: significant loss of value to a small fraction of the heritage asset, or a small loss of value in most or a significant fraction of the heritage asset is likely in one century; 
* medium: small damage or loss of value to the heritage asset over many centuries; 
* low: minimal or insignificant damage or loss of value to the heritage asset over many millennia.

By considering the criterion, stakeholders can discuss within the institution and decide which level of risk is acceptable, and which ones are not.

Also, it is very useful for an organization to be able to set certain conditions to the criteria used to do the evaluation. For example, the organization might decide that reducing risks below a certain magnitude (e.g. MR > 10) is simply not worth any effort, i.e. that such risks are acceptable.

## Example 01
The risk of a large fire affecting a museum and its contents (MR=12.5) has an extreme priority. The uncertainty that has been measured amounts to a value equal to 1.0. A risk of this magnitude is equivalent to losing about 3% of the heritage asset value every 10 years (or 30% per century, or 100% in about 300 years). The museum direction considers this level of risk as ‘not acceptable’, since as a condition the value of MR is higher than 10 and the value of uncertainty is lower than 2.

The risk of opportunistic theft of objects on display (MR=10.5) has a high priority. It is 100 times smaller than the fire risk. The uncertainty that has been measured amounts to a value equal to 2.5. A risk of this magnitude is equivalent to losing about 0.3% of the heritage asset value every 100 years (or 3% per millennium). The museum direction considers this level of risk as ‘just beyond acceptable’, since as a condition the value of MR is slightly higher than 10 and the value of uncertainty is higher than 2.

The risk of deterioration of archival documents caused by low quality storage boxes (MR=7.5) has a medium (almost low) priority. It is 1 000 times smaller than the theft risk, and 100 000 times smaller than the fire risk. The uncertainty that has been measured amounts to a value equal to 1.0. A risk of this magnitude is equivalent to losing about 0.003% of the heritage asset value per millennium. The museum direction considers this level of risk as ‘acceptable’, since as a condition the value of MR is lower than 10 and the value of uncertainty is lower than 2.
