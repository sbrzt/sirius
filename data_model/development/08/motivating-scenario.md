## Name
Re-engineering of assessment activity

## Description
An assessment activity is a situated action that involves gaining and producing scientific knowledge through observations of some entity and that is parameterized according to a series of elements:
* it has a type: e.g. context description, identification, analysis, evaluation, treatment, etc.;
* it takes place somewhere;
* it is carried out by some agent(s) (e.g. a person, an organization, a software);
* it occurs within a certain time interval;
* it can be documented by some source (e.g. a document);
* it can be described with natural language (e.g. through notes);
* it produces some observation(s).

An observation is a situation during which some entity (e.g. a baptistery, a collection of books, a language) is observed and some characteristics of it (called dimensions) are assessed. Much like an assessment activity, an observation is also parametrized according to a series of elements:
* it has a type: e.g. context observation, value observation, risk observation, measurement, evaluation, treament option, etc.;
* it is carried out by some agent (e.g. a person);
* it occurs in a certain point in time;
* it can be documented by some source (e.g. a document);
* it can be described with natural language (e.g. through notes);
* it observes some dimensions of the entity it observes.

A dimension is some qualitative or quantitative property related to some entity that is being observed during an observation, such as: the economic context in which the entity exists, the type of risk the entity is subjected to, the type of deteriorating agent threatening the entity's integrity, the magnitude of risk, the level of priority assigned to the risk, the type of treatment option selected to deal with the risk, and so on. A dimension is characterized as follows:
* it has a value: e.g. an integer, a string of text, a percentage, etc.;
* it has a type: e.g. risk type (common risk, rare risk, cumulative risk), context type (physical context, political context, legal context, administrative context, economic context, socio-cultural context), measure type (frequency, fractional value loss, exposure, magnitude of risk), etc.;
* it can be expressed according to some kind of measurement unit.
