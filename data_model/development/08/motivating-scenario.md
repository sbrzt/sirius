## Name
Re-engineering of assessment activity

## Description
An <mark>assessment activity</mark> is a situated action that involves gaining and producing scientific knowledge through observations of some entity and that is parameterized according to a series of elements:
* it <u>has a <mark>type</mark></u>: e.g. context description, identification, analysis, evaluation, treatment, etc.;
* it <u>takes <mark>place</mark></u> somewhere;
* it <u>is carried out</u> and <u>participated by</u> some <mark>agent</mark> (e.g. a person, an organization, a software);
* it <u>occurs within</u> a certain <mark>time interval</mark>;
* it can be <u>documented by</u> some <mark>information object</mark> (e.g. a document);
* it can be <u>described with</u> natural language (e.g. through notes);
* it <u>consists of</u> some observation(s).

An <mark>observation</mark> is a situation during which some entity (e.g. a baptistery, a collection of books, a language) is observed and some characteristics of it (called parameters) are assessed. Much like an assessment activity, an observation is also parametrized according to a series of elements:
* it <u>has a <mark>type</mark></u>: e.g. context observation, value observation, hazard observation, measure observation, etc.;
* it is <u>carried out by</u> some <mark>agent</mark> (e.g. a person);
* it <u>occurs at</u> a certain point in time;
* it can be <u>documented by</u> some <mark>information object</mark> (e.g. a document);
* it can be <u>described with</u> natural language (e.g. through notes);
* it <u>observes</u> an <mark>entity</mark>;
* it <u>uses some <mark>parameter</mark></u>.

A <mark>parameter</mark> is some qualitative or quantitative property of the reality surrounding the observed entity, such as: the economic context in which the entity exists, the type of risk the entity is subjected to, the type of deteriorating agent threatening the entity's integrity, the magnitude of risk, the level of priority assigned to the risk, the type of treatment option selected to deal with the risk, and so on. A parameter is characterized as follows:
* it <u>has a value</u>: e.g. an integer, a string of text, a percentage, etc.;
* it <u>has a <mark>type</mark></u>: e.g. risk type (common risk, rare risk, cumulative risk), context type (physical context, political context, legal context, administrative context, economic context, socio-cultural context), measure type (frequency, fractional value loss, exposure, magnitude of risk), etc.

## Example 01
An assessment activity `:assessment-activity-01` consisting in the context description of a heritage asset `:baptistery`, is taking place in Ravenna, is being carried out by the expert Sara Fiorentino (with the involvement of other stakeholders, such as Comune di Ravenna, Soprintendenza di Ravenna and Università di Bologna), in the time interval starting from 2024-02-01 to 2024-03-01, and is being annotated with the following text: "Edificio a pianta ottagonale con copertura a spioventi, presenta quattro absidiole in corrispondenza dei punti cardinali (parzialmente interrate). La decorazione musiva è conservata sulla sola cupola, creando un sorprendente contrasto con la superficie grezza dei mattoni a vista nella parte inferiore. Il mosaico rappresenta al centro il battesimo di Cristo nel fiume Giordano, attorno ad esso una fascia con i dodici apostoli che sfilano in due teorie, incontrandosi presso il trono dell'etimasìa, simbolo della presenza invisibile di Cristo."

## Example 04
An assessment activity `:assessment-activity-07` consisting in the evaluation of risks related to a heritage asset `:baptistery`, is taking place in Ravenna and is being carried out by the expert Sara Fiorentino, in the time interval starting from 2024-05-01 to 2024-06-01, continutin `:assessment-activity-05`. It is annotated with the following text: "The risk of flood (MR = 10.5) has a high priority. It is 100 times smaller than the fire risk. The uncertainty that has been measured amounts to a value equal to 2.5. A risk of this magnitude is equivalent to losing about 0.3% of the heritage asset value every 100 years (or 3% per millennium). The museum direction considers this level of risk as just beyond acceptable, since as a condition the value of MR is slightly higher than 10 and the value of uncertainty is higher than 2." It consists of two observations, each observing the asset in question:
1. `:observation-24`, which was carried out by Sara Fiorentino in date 2024-05-03, is a PRIORITY observation  motivated by `:parameter-16`. It uses a parameter `:parameter-21`, with type `high-priority`;

It is annotated with the following text: "The risk of a large fire affecting the baptistery and its contents (MR = 12.5) has an extreme priority. The uncertainty that has been measured amounts to a value equal to 1.0. A risk of this magnitude is equivalent to losing about 3% of the heritage asset value every 10 years (or 30% per century, or 100% in about 300 years). The museum direction considers this level of risk as ‘not acceptable’, since as a condition the value of MR is higher than 10 and the value of uncertainty is lower than 2." It consists of two observations:
1. `:observation-26`, which was carried out by Sara Fiorentino in date 2024-05-15, is a PRIORITY observation motivated by `:parameter-20`. It uses a `:parameter-23`, with type `extreme-priority`;
