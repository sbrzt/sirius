## Question 1

### Identifier
CQ_8.1

### Question
What are the contextual observations observing the heritage asset `:baptistery` and produced by the relative context description activity? Which dimensions are they observing?

### Expected outcome

### Results
* `:observation-01`, `context-observation`, "The Baptistery is externally visible on the N, NW, and NE sides. The west side overlooks the gardens of a private residence, while the south, SW, and SE sides overlook the garden of the Department of Cultural Heritage (University of Bologna).", "Sara Fiorentino", "2024-02-01", None, `:dimension-01`, `physical-context`, `:activity-01`
* `:observation-02`, `context-observation`, "Monumental site in an urban area, open to tourists (with prior admission ticket). The small square where the building is located suffers from a bad reputation, being labeled as a 'socially risky area and a neglected place' (reported incident of an abandoned bed frame found at night in the Baptistery's trench, 11.07.2006, Source: Zaccarini, 2015). Despite the establishment of regulations in 2012 restricting vehicle access to the square, transit and parking for loading/unloading goods are still permitted.", "Sara Fiorentino", "2024-02-02", None, `:dimension-02`, `socio-cultural-context`, `:activity-01`
* `:observation-03`, `context-observation`, "The monument is often a subject of debate among various political parties and the Municipality of Ravenna.", "Sara Fiorentino", "2024-02-03", http://www.ravennaincomune.it/wp/index.php/2020/05/23/telecamere-di-sorveglianza-allassalto-del-battistero-degli-ariani, `:dimension-03`, `political-context`, `:activity-01`
* `:observation-04`, `context-observation`, "Owned by the State Property / Ministry of Culture. Since 1996, it has been part of the list of Italian sites designated as UNESCO World Heritage (‘Early Christian Monuments of Ravenna’).", "Sara Fiorentino", "2024-02-04", None, `:dimension-04`, `legal-context`, `:activity-01`
* `:observation-05`, `context-observation`, "Since December 2019, it has been managed by the Regional Directorate of Museums of Emilia Romagna, located in Ravenna.", "Sara Fiorentino", "2024-02-05", None, `:dimension-05`, `administrative-context`, `:activity-01`
* `:observation-06`, `context-observation`, "The Law No. 77 of February 20, 2006, establishes that UNESCO sites are excellences of the Italian cultural, landscape, and natural heritage, fundamental elements of our country's representation at the international level, and states that interventions on them have priority even in terms of the allocation of financial resources.", "Sara Fiorentino", "2024-02-06", None, `:dimension-06`, `economic-context`, `:activity-01`
