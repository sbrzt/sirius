## Name
Value assessment

## Description
This step consists in examining the values that contribute to the relative significance or importance of an asset.  

A heritage asset is a physical or tangible item, structure, site, or object that holds historical, cultural, architectural, archaeological, or artistic significance. For instance, the ‘heritage asset’ could be all archaeological sites in the country, or one particular archaeological site, or only a specific part of an archaeological site. It could be all historic house museums in the city, one particular historic house museum, or only a specific part of the collection of one museum. Thus, a heritage asset can be made up by multiple other items, which in turn are all heritage assets. For buildings and sites, items can also be physical components. A group may be a building, and its items may be its components, such as windows, walls, special decorative elements, etc.

Each part of a heritage asset has some value assigned to it during a value assessment activity. A value is a quality that represents the relative significance or importance of an asset. Each contributing value is characterized by a dimension (a facet of the asset that contributes to the overall understanding and assessment of its value), an aspect (a facet of the context that contributes to the overall understanding and assessment of the asset value), a time interval with a start and a end date, and a score. Moreover, a contributing value can be documented by some document and textual description.

The dimensions that can be taken into consideration are:
* Artistic: a dimension that pertains to the aesthetic qualities and creative expression embodied in cultural heritage.
* Historic: a dimension that refers to the historical context, significance, and evolution of cultural heritage.
* Social: a dimension that considers the cultural and social context of heritage, including its role in shaping identity, community values, and social practices.
* Scientific: a dimension that involves the application of research, documentation, and analysis techniques to understand, preserve, and interpret cultural heritage.

The aspects that can be taken into consideration are:
* Form: an aspect that refers to the physical characteristics and appearance of a cultural heritage item or site.
* Substance: an aspect that involves the material composition and integrity of a cultural heritage item.
* Function: an aspect that pertains to the purpose and use of a cultural heritage item or site.
* Tradition: an aspect that refers to the customs, practices, and knowledge associated with a cultural heritage item or site.
* Setting: an aspect that involves the surroundings and environment in which a cultural heritage item or site is located.
* Feeling: an aspect that encompasses the intangible and emotional aspects associated with a cultural heritage item or site.
