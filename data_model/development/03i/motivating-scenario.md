# Iteration 03

## Name
Analysis - Layers and values

## Description
This step consists in identifying during the risk assessment all the risks that threaten the heritage asset. This is done by examining the contributing value of each part that contitutes the asset against the framework of “layers” existing around it. 

A heritage asset is a physical or tangible item, structure, site, or object that holds historical, cultural, architectural, archaeological, or artistic significance. For instance, the ‘heritage asset’ could be all archaeological sites in the country, or one particular archaeological site, or only a specific part of an archaeological site. It could be all historic house museums in the city, one particular historic house museum, or only a specific part of the collection of one museum. Thus, a heritage asset can be made up by multiple other items, which in turn are all heritage assets. For buildings and sites, items can also be physical components. A group may be a building, and its items may be its components, such as windows, walls, special decorative elements, etc.

Each part of a heritage asset has some value assigned to it during a value assessment activity. A value is a single parameter that equates to relative significance, or relative importance of that asset. Each contributing value is characterized by a  dimension (a facet of the asset that contributes to the overall understanding and assessment of authenticity), a time interval with a start and a end date, a note, and a score. Moreover, a contributing value can be documented by some sources and exists within a certain aspect (a facet of the context that contributes to the overall understanding and assessment of authenticity).

The layers can be interpred as the series of locations that constitute the spatial context the risk exists within. They are:
* Region: the location of hazards that cannot be avoided;
* Site: the location of outdoor hazards, but for which it is possible to have some degree of control;
* Building: the fundamental built layer around any collection;
* Room: the location of special controls as well as new hazards;
* Fitting: the first movable layer, often part of a transition in responsibilities between the facilities manager and the conservator;
* Support: the closest layers to the heritage asset, always intended as protective, but which may also be a source of new hazards.

In terms of occurrence (timing), risks can be divided into two main groups: events and cumulative processes. For practical purposes, events can be further divided into rare and common events. The result is three practical types of risk occurrence: rare events, common events, and cumulative processes.

“Rare” events occur less often than approximately once every 100 years (from the perspective of one heritage organization.) As a result, rare events are not part of the direct experience of most heritage organization staff. From the perspective of the total heritage of a nation, such events may happen every few years, and from a global perspective, these events can become routine.

Common events occur many times per century. These are events that are part of the direct experience of many heritage organization staff or of people in the vicinity of the heritage organization.

Cumulative processes can occur continuously or intermittently. Over the years, most heritage organization staff will have observed the cumulative effect of one or two such processes on some items, that is to say, they will have seen the item “age.” Very frequent events (more than once a year) can also be considered as cumulative processes for risk analysis.

## Example 01
A series of risk assessment activities assign a set of risks to the heritage asset "Battistero degli Ariani". The heritage asset is composed by:
* a building
* some furniture
* mosaics
* mural paintings

The contributing values are:
* Social, with weight "1", degree of occurrence "3", definition "Objects have social significance if they are held in community esteem." and note "This may be demonstrated by social, spiritual, or cultural expressions that provide evidence of a community’s strong affection for an object or collection and of how it contributes to that community’s identity and social cohesion";
* Historic, with weight "5", degree of occurrence "81", definition "An object may be historically significant for its association with people, events, places, or themes." and note "Historically significant objects range those associated with famous people and important events to those illustrating daily life, used by ordinary people";		
* Artistic, with weight "10", degree of occurrence "243", and definition "An object may be aesthetically significant for its craftsmanship, style, technical excellence, beauty, demonstration of skill, or quality of design and execution".

The value assessments assign
* "Historic" and "Artistic" contributing values to the building within the context of the risk assessment which assigns a risk to the building that exists within the "site" and the "region" layers; the item quantity is "1" and the percentage of total value is "40";
* "Social" and "Historic" contributing values to the furniture within the context of the risk assessment which assigns a risk to the furniture that exists within the "building", "site" and "region" layers; the item quantity is "5" and the percentage of total value is "5";
* "Artistic" contributing value to the mosaics within the context of the risk assessment which assigns a risk to the mosaics that exists within the "building", "site" and "region" layers; the item quantity is "10" and the percentage of total value is "40";
* "Artistic" contributing value to the mural paintings within the context of the risk assessment which assigns a risk to the mural paintings that exists within the "building", "site" and "region" layers; the item quantity is "5" and the percentage of total value is "15".
