## Description
This step consists in identifying the risks that threaten the heritage asset. This is done by examining elements such as the agents of deterioration that embody the possible risks, the type of these risks, and the layers in which they exist. 

A heritage asset is a physical or tangible item, structure, site, or object that holds historical, cultural, architectural, archaeological, or artistic significance.

A risk affecting a heritage asset is conceptualized as the possibility of a loss of value to the heritage asset. A risk is classified by a type, exists within one (ore more) layer(s), and can be documented by some document.

An agent of deterioration is a conceptualization of a possible hazard that can be used to classify a risk threatening the heritage asset, made from the perspective of the heritage asset itself. The agents of deterioration are:
* Dissociation: an agent of deterioration representing the natural tendency for ordered systems to fall apart over time. Dissociation results in loss of objects, or object-related data, or the ability to retrieve or associate objects and data;
* Fire: an agent of deterioration representing the destruction of an asset due to properties of fire, such as heat, flames, or smoke;
* Incorrect relative humidity: an agent of deterioration representing the situation in which the level of humidity in the environment deviates from the optimal or specified range;
* Incorrect temperature: an agent of deterioration representing a situation in which the ambient temperature deviates from the optimal or specified range;
* Light, ultraviolet and red: an agent of deterioration representing different forms of electromagnetic radiation;
* Pests: an agent of deterioration representing the presence of biological agents, such as insects, rodents, and microorganisms;
* Physical forces: an agent of deterioration representing mechanical damage resulting from handling, transport, and vibration;
* Pollutants: an agent of deterioration representing the presence of substances or contaminants introduced into the environment;
* Theft and vandalism: an agent of deterioration representing deliberate acts of theft, vandalism, or destruction done by humans;
* Water: an agent of deterioration representing the damage that can occur through leaks, flooding, or high humidity levels.

A layer is a location that constitutes the spatial context in which the risk affecting the heritage exists. They are:
* Region: the location of hazards that cannot be avoided;
* Site: the location of outdoor hazards, but for which it is possible to have some degree of control;
* Building: the fundamental built layer around any collection;
* Room: the location of special controls as well as new hazards;
* Fitting: the first movable layer, often part of a transition in responsibilities between the facilities manager and the conservator;
* Support: the closest layers to the heritage asset, always intended as protective, but which may also be a source of new hazards.

In terms of occurrence (timing), risks can be divided into two main groups: events and cumulative processes. For practical purposes, events can be further divided into rare and common events. The result is three practical types of risk:
* Rare events occur less often than approximately once every 100 years (from the perspective of one heritage organization.) As a result, rare events are not part of the direct experience of most heritage organization staff. From the perspective of the total heritage of a nation, such events may happen every few years, and from a global perspective, these events can become routine;
* Common events occur many times per century. These are events that are part of the direct experience of many heritage organization staff or of people in the vicinity of the heritage organization;
* Cumulative processes can occur continuously or intermittently. Over the years, most heritage organization staff will have observed the cumulative effect of one or two such processes on some items, that is to say, they will have seen the item “age.” Very frequent events (more than once a year) can also be considered as cumulative processes for risk analysis.

## Example 01
A set of risks that threaten a baptistery are identified as:
* "Physical destruction" is classified by the agent of deterioration "Physical forces", by the risk type "Cumulative", within the layer "Building", at time "2020-10-10", documented by "Document A";
* "Fragmentation of data", described as "Fragmentation of data related to previous incorrect monitoring and maintenance interventions provokes loss of important information related to the baptistery", is classified by the agent of deterioration "Dissociation", by the risk type "Rare", within the layer "Site", at time "2020-10-10", documented by "Document B";
* "Animal and plant colonization", is classified by the agent of deterioration "Pests", by the risk type "Common event", within the layer "Region", at time "2020-10-11", documented by "Document A";
* "Walls erosion", described by "Floods and heavy rains induce erosion of the baptistery walls", is classified by the agent of deterioration "Water", by the risk type "Rare event", within the layer "Region", at time "2020-10-10", documented by "Document B".
