# Iteration 02

## Name
Analysis - Agents of deterioration

## Description
This step consists in identifying during the risk assessment all the risks that threaten the heritage asset. This is done by examining the possible agents of deterioration that embody the possible risks and by framing such analysis via risk summary sentences.

A heritage asset is a physical or tangible item, structure, site, or object that holds historical, cultural, architectural, archaeological, or artistic significance.

A risk affecting a heritage asset is conceptualized as the possibility of a loss of value to the heritage asset, and is assigned to the asset through a risk assessment activity.

The risk summary is a complete and meaningful sentence that describes a risk in term of the hazard, the agent of deterioration, the adverse effect, and the heritage asset affected.

The 10 agents of deterioration are a classification scheme for all possible hazards to the heritage asset, made from the perspective of the heritage asset itself. They allow one to think where the hazard originates from and which adverse effects are caused. According to this framework, an agent of deterioration (e.g. "Physical Force") is a type of threat to a heritage asset that originates from a certain hazard (e.g. an earthquake) and causes an adverse effect (e.g. collapse).

## Example 01
A risk assessment activity assigns a set of risks to the heritage asset "Battistero degli Ariani". In particular, the risks are the following:
* "Physical destruction", embodied by the agent of deterioration "Physical forces", which originates from "traffic-induced vibration", "civil works", "earthquake", "subsidence" and causes "fissuring", "collapse" and "feature detachment";
* "Fragmentation of data", described as "Fragmentation of data related to previous incorrect monitoring and maintenance interventions provokes loss of important information related to the baptistery", embodied by the agent of deterioration "Dissociation", which originates from "incorrect data management" and causes "information loss";
* "Animal and plant colonization", embodied by the agent of deterioration "Pests", which originates from "birds" and "weeds" and causes "excrements" and "overgrowth";
* "Walls erosion", described by "Floods and heavy rains induce erosion of the baptistery walls", embodied by the agent of deterioration "Water", which originates from "flood" and "rainfall" and causes "corrosion";
* "Fires due to equipment malfunction", embodied by the agent of deterioration "Fire", which originates from "equipment malfunction", and causes non-assessable adverse effects;
* "Anthropic activity", described as "Various motivations cause the presence of graffiti and abandonment of objects in the area surrounding the baptistery", embodied by the agent of deterioration "Theft and vandalism", which originates from "political motivation", "ideological motivation", "economic motivation" and causes "disfiguration" and "waste accumulation".
