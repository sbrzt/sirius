Context step

## Description
This step involves the understanding of all relevant aspects of the context in which the heritage asset is situated. This includes its physical, administrative, legal, political, socio-cultural, and economic environments. This contextual information related to the heritage asset is documented by a series of documents. A document may be characterized a title, a description, an external link, and a link to the actual file.

A heritage asset is a physical or tangible item, structure, site, or object that holds historical, cultural, architectural, archaeological, or artistic significance and is considered worthy of preservation and protection. For instance, the ‘heritage asset’ could be all archaeological sites in the country, or one particular archaeological site, or only a specific part of an archaeological site. It could be all historic house museums in the city, one particular historic house museum, or only a specific part of the collection of one museum. Thus, a heritage asset can be made up by multiple other items, which in turn are all heritage assets. An heritage asset is characterized by a 

The items that contitute a heritage asset belong to categories or subgroups, which in turn are part of larger groups, such as "Site", "Building", and "Collection".

A heritage asset is also associated with a certain value, which is a single parameter that equates to relative significance, or relative importance. Each value is in turn characterized by a name, a definition, a series of notes, and its relative weight.

## Example 01
A heritage site contains the remains of an ancient village plus a museum and a windmill. In a technical report, it is reported that the site is located in a moderately seismic rural area, nearby a river, and that there is a native community nearby that uses part of the site as a sacred place. Another document (a survey) reports that there is a growing demand for access to the site by national and international tourism. It has no management plan, and there are no specific laws that regulate the protection and economic exploitation of this kind of heritage in the country.

The heritage site is characterized by three values:
* Social: Objects have social significance if they are held in community esteem. This may be demonstrated by social, spiritual, or cultural expressions that provide evidence of a community’s strong affection for an object or collection and of how it contributes to that community’s identity and social cohesion. Weight 1.
* Historic: An object may be historically significant for its association with people, events, places, or themes. Historically significant objects range those associated with famous people and important events to those illustrating daily life, used by ordinary people. Weight 5.	
* Artistic: An object may be aesthetically significant for its craftsmanship, style, technical excellence, beauty, demonstration of skill, or quality of design and execution. Weight 10.

The village belongs to the group "Village", while the museum and the windmill belong to the group "Building". They are all subgroups of the group "Site". The museum has an Artistic value. The village has a Historic value. The windmill has a Social value.
