## Name
Analysis - Layers and values

## Description
This step consists in identifying during the risk assessment all the risks that threaten the heritage asset. This is done by examining the contributing value of each part that contitutes the asset against the framework of “layers” existing around it. 

A heritage asset is a physical or tangible item, structure, site, or object that holds historical, cultural, architectural, archaeological, or artistic significance. For instance, the ‘heritage asset’ could be all archaeological sites in the country, or one particular archaeological site, or only a specific part of an archaeological site. It could be all historic house museums in the city, one particular historic house museum, or only a specific part of the collection of one museum. Thus, a heritage asset can be made up by multiple other items, which in turn are all heritage assets. For buildings and sites, items can also be physical components. A group may be a building, and its items may be its components, such as windows, walls, special decorative elements, etc.

Each part of a heritage asset has some value assigned to it during a value assessment activity. A value is a single parameter that equates to relative significance, or relative importance of that asset. Each contributing value is characterized by a type, a name, a definition, a series of notes, a time interval with a start and a end date, a degree of occurrence, and its relative weight. A value exists within the context of a risk assessment activity. During the value assessment activity, the quantity of items relative to the asset, as well as its percentage of value, are assigned.

The layers can be interpred as the series of locations that constitute the spatial context within the risk exists. They are:
* Region: the location of hazards that we cannot avoid, but which we must understand, predict, and then mitigate appropriately;
* Site: the location of outdoor hazards, but for which we have some degree of control;
* Building: the fundamental built layer around any collection;
* Room: the location of special controls as well as new hazards;
* Fitting: the first movable layer, often part of a transition in responsibilities between the facilities manager and the conservator;
* Support: the closest layers to the heritage asset, always intended as protective, but they may also be a source of new hazards.

## Example 01
A series of risk assessment activities assign a set of risks to the heritage asset "Battistero degli Ariani". The heritage asset is composed by:
* a building
* some furniture
* mosaics
* mural paintings

The contributing values are:
* Social, with weight "1", degree of occurrence "3", definition "Objects have social significance if they are held in community esteem." and note "This may be demonstrated by social, spiritual, or cultural expressions that provide evidence of a community’s strong affection for an object or collection and of how it contributes to that community’s identity and social cohesion";
* Historic, with weight "5", degree of occurrence "81", definition "An object may be historically significant for its association with people, events, places, or themes." and note "Historically significant objects range those associated with famous people and important events to those illustrating daily life, used by ordinary people";		
* Artistic, with weight "10", degree of occurrence "243", and definition "An object may be aesthetically significant for its craftsmanship, style, technical excellence, beauty, demonstration of skill, or quality of design and execution".

The value assessments assign
* "Historic" and "Artistic" contributing values to the building within the context of the risk assessment which assigns a risk to the building that exists within the "site" and the "region" layers; the item quantity is "1" and the percentage of total value is "40";
* "Social" and "Historic" contributing values to the furniture within the context of the risk assessment which assigns a risk to the furniture that exists within the "building", "site" and "region" layers; the item quantity is "5" and the percentage of total value is "5";
* "Artistic" contributing value to the mosaics within the context of the risk assessment which assigns a risk to the mosaics that exists within the "building", "site" and "region" layers; the item quantity is "10" and the percentage of total value is "40";
* "Artistic" contributing value to the mural paintings within the context of the risk assessment which assigns a risk to the mural paintings that exists within the "building", "site" and "region" layers; the item quantity is "5" and the percentage of total value is "15".
