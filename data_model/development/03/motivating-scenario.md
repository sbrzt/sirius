## Description
This step involves the measurement of each specific risk identified to understand it in detail, estimating its chance of occurrence and expected impact. To do so, numeric scales (referred to as the ABC scales) are used to quantify the frequency or rate of occurrence and the expected loss of value for different risks. The ABC scales consist of three components, where Component 'A' quantifies the frequency of risk, and Components 'B' and 'C' together quantify the expected loss of value to the heritage asset implied by such risk. The combination of A, B, and C defines the magnitude of risk. In detail:

* A: For 'event' risks, this component indicates how often the event is expected to occur, i.e., the average time between two consecutive events. For 'cumulative processes,' this component indicates how many years it will take for a certain level of damage to accumulate.
* B: This component indicates the size of the expected loss of value in each item of the heritage asset affected by the risk.
* C: This component indicates how much of the heritage asset value is affected by the risk.

After scoring the three components of each risk using the ABC scales, the magnitude of risk (MR), representing its potential to cause loss of value to the heritage asset, can be calculated. To quantify each risk component, information needs to be collected and analyzed from documents, including regional statistics, local and common knowledge, and scientific and technical knowledge.

When analyzing risks, the aim is to predict the loss of value to the heritage asset in the future, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty. To express this uncertainty, the ABC scales provide scores for the most likely, 'worst case,' and 'best case' scenarios for each risk component. This results in three scores for each component, reflecting the low, most likely, and high estimates, thereby presenting the magnitude of risk with three MR values (low, most likely, high) to indicate the level of uncertainty.

## Example 01
A large fire is a rare, but very relevant risk for a museum. National statistics from different countries show that the average time between large fire events for museums with basic fire control measures is about 300 years. The A-score in this case would be A=2 (low estimate), A=2.5 (probable estimate), A=3 (high estimate), indicating an expectation of a large fire once every 300 years.

Considering the combustible nature of the museum building and its contents, a total or almost total loss of value is expected in each item affected by the fire. The B-score is B=4.5 (low estimate), B=5 (probable estimate), B=5 (high estimate).

Given the characteristics of the building and its contents, it is expected that all or most of the heritage asset and its value would be affected in the event of a large fire. The C-score is C=4.5 (low estimate), C=5 (probable estimate), C=5 (high estimate).

The magnitude of risk is MR=11 (low estimate), MR=12.5 (probable estimate), MR=13 (high estimate).

To summarize: a large fire event is expected in the museum approximately once every 300 years, with the fire affecting all or most of the heritage asset value, causing total or almost total loss of value in each affected item.

## Example 02
Theft is also a risk but is more frequent than large fires. In this example, staff memory indicates that the collection has suffered 3 theft events affecting objects on display in the past 75 years, estimating an average time of 25 years between theft events. The A-score in this case would be A=3 (low estimate), A=3.5 (probable estimate), A=4 (high estimate).

A stolen item results in a complete loss of value for the museum and its public. The B-score is B=4.5 (low estimate), B=5 (probable estimate), B=5 (high estimate).

The most probable scenario is the opportunistic theft of a small, original object of the collection displayed without protection. The C-score is C=1.5 (low estimate), C=2 (probable estimate), C=2.5 (high estimate), indicating a tiny fraction of the heritage asset value affected per event.

The magnitude of risk is MR=9 (probable estimate), MR=10.5 (probable estimate), MR=11 (high estimate).

To summarize: an opportunistic theft event is expected in the museum approximately once every 25 years, most likely affecting 1 original object of the collection on display or a tiny fraction of the heritage asset value per event, resulting in a total loss of the stolen item.

## Example 03
An archive is at risk of deterioration by exposure to volatile substances released by cardboard boxes. For a period of 30 years, the A-score is A=3 (low estimate), A=3.5 (probable estimate), A=4 (high estimate).

Observations on similar collections show a tiny loss of value in each item affected over 30 years. The B-score is B=1.5 (low estimate), B=2 (probable estimate), B=2.5 (high estimate).

Only a tiny fraction of the heritage asset value is expected to be affected per event. The C-score is C=1.5 (low estimate), C=2 (probable estimate), C=2.5 (high estimate).

The magnitude of risk is MR=6 (low estimate), MR=7.5 (probable estimate), MR=9 (high estimate).

To summarize: over a period of 30 years, a tiny loss of value is expected to accumulate in about 1% of the archival items due to their storage inside 'low-quality' cardboard boxes.
