# Iteration 03

## Name
Analysis - Layers

## Description
This step consists in identifying during the risk assessment all the risks that threaten the heritage asset. This is done by examining the asset against the framework of “layers” existing around it. 

A heritage asset is a physical or tangible item, structure, site, or object that holds historical, cultural, architectural, archaeological, or artistic significance.

A risk affecting a heritage asset is conceptualized as the possibility of a loss of value to the heritage asset, and is assigned to the asset through a risk assessment activity. A risk is characterized by having a type, existing within one (ore more) layer(s), being documented by some document, and a time interval in which it takes place.

The layers can be interpred as the series of locations that constitute the spatial context the risk affecting the heritage exists within. They are:
* Region: the location of hazards that cannot be avoided;
* Site: the location of outdoor hazards, but for which it is possible to have some degree of control;
* Building: the fundamental built layer around any collection;
* Room: the location of special controls as well as new hazards;
* Fitting: the first movable layer, often part of a transition in responsibilities between the facilities manager and the conservator;
* Support: the closest layers to the heritage asset, always intended as protective, but which may also be a source of new hazards.

In terms of occurrence (timing), risks can be divided into two main groups: events and cumulative processes. For practical purposes, events can be further divided into rare and common events. The result is three practical types of risk: rare events, common events, and cumulative processes.

Rare events occur less often than approximately once every 100 years (from the perspective of one heritage organization.) As a result, rare events are not part of the direct experience of most heritage organization staff. From the perspective of the total heritage of a nation, such events may happen every few years, and from a global perspective, these events can become routine.

Common events occur many times per century. These are events that are part of the direct experience of many heritage organization staff or of people in the vicinity of the heritage organization.

Cumulative processes can occur continuously or intermittently. Over the years, most heritage organization staff will have observed the cumulative effect of one or two such processes on some items, that is to say, they will have seen the item “age.” Very frequent events (more than once a year) can also be considered as cumulative processes for risk analysis.

## Example 01
A series of risk assessment activities assign a set of risks to a baptistery. In particular, the risk assessments assign
* a risk with type "Cumulative process", within the layer "Building", at time "2020-10-10", documented by "Document A";
* a risk with type "Rare event", within the layer "Site", at time "2020-10-10", documented by "Document B";
* a risk with type "Common event", within the layer "Region", at time "2020-10-11", documented by "Document A".

## Example 02
A series of risk assessment activities assign a set of risks to a museum. In particular, the risk assessments assign
* a risk with type "Rare event", within the layer "Support", at time "2020-10-10", documented by "Document B";
* a risk with type "Rare event", within the layer "Fitting", at time "2020-10-11", documented by "Document C".
* a risk with type "Cumulative process", within the layer "Room", at time "2020-10-11", documented by "Document C";
* a risk with type "Rare event", within the layer "Region", at time "2020-10-11", documented by "Document A".
